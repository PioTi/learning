Content-Disposition: Proposed as a means for the origin server to suggest a default file name 
(http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec19.html)


In Vim, use 'n' for forward search and 'N' for backward search


`find -iname` to ignore the case when searching for files


When using "top", use "c" to toggle between process name and the command line

If your tests has docstrings, nose will display the string instead of
the default function/method name:http://bit.ly/1VfJnfr
