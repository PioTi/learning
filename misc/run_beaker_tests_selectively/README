Selectively run the tests based on what's changed in HEAD.

Copy these two files in the ``IntegrationTests`` directory of your beaker
clone.

If only files in Client/ has changed, only run client tests
If only files in documentation/ has changed, do not run any tests,
else run all tests

Can be further fine tuned.
